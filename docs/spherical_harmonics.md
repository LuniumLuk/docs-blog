# Spherical harmonics

In rendering a realistic scene in computer graphics, skylight is implemented with a skybox which essentially a image mapped to a sphere whose radius is set to infinite. The common way of spped up this global illumination is to precompute a environment map that represent incident illumination at a point. But overall, it is still costly to compute even a 64 * 64 enviroment map.

We thus adopt spherical harmonics to represent enviroment map and focuses on the Lambertian component of the BRDF.

for a point in a surface, the irradiance E is a function of the surface normal only and given by a integral over the upper hemisphere $\Omega(n)$ :
$$
E(\mathbf{n}) = \int_{\Omega(\mathbf{n})}L(\omega)(\mathbf{n}\cdot\omega)d\omega
$$
Here, $\omega$ and $\mathbf{n}$ are unit direction vectors, therefore, we can describe E and L as a BRDF, i.e. a parameterization by a direction $(\theta,\phi)$

To approximate E, we derive a method adopting spherical harmonics. Harmonics are solutions to laplace's equation, and we take the spherical harmonic coefficients $Y_{lm}$ ï¼Œwhich are analogue on the sphere to the Fourier basis on line or circle. We utilize the first three layers of SH that is:
$$
Y_{lm} = \begin{cases}
\sqrt{2}K_{lm}cos(m\varphi)P_{lm}(cos(\theta)) & m>0 \\
\sqrt{2}K_{lm}cos(m\varphi)P_{l|m|}(cos(\theta)) & m<0 \\
K_{l0}P_{l0}cos(\theta) & m=0
\end{cases}
$$
where:
$$
K_{lm}=\sqrt{\frac{(2l+1)(l-|m|)!}{4\pi(l+m)!}}
$$
and P is calculated iteratively:
$$
P_{00}=1 \\
P_{mm} = (1-2m)P_{m-1,m-1} \\
p_{m+1,m} = (2m+1)zP_{mm} \\
p_{lm} = \frac{(2l-1)zP_{l-1,m}-(l+m-1)P_{l-2,m}}{l-m}
$$
In computer graphics, these coefficients are precomputed as fixed float values and we only take the first 9 coefficients, therefore, we have:
$$
\begin{align*}
(x,y,z) &= (sin\theta cos\phi,sin\theta sin\phi, cos\theta) \\
Y_{00}(\theta,\phi)&=0.282095 \\
(Y_{11};Y_{10};Y_{1,-1})(\theta,\phi) &= 0.488603(x;y;z) \\
(Y_{21};Y_{2,-1};Y_{2,-1})(\theta,\phi) &= 1.092548(xz;yz;xy) \\
Y_{20}(\theta,\phi) &= 0.315392(3z^2-1) \\
Y_{22}(\theta,\phi) &= 0.546274(x^2-y^2)
\end{align*}
$$
So, we can now write L and E in:
$$
L(\theta,\phi) = \sum_{l,m}L_{lm}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi) \\
E(\theta,\phi) = \sum_{l,m}E_{lm}Y_{lm}(\theta,\phi)
$$
