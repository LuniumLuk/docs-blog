## History

### Early Age

From early age of Games, there's no such concepts as Game Engine. Developers were mainly dealing with limited memory and performance. A Golden Age of Game Dev.

Father of Game Engine -> John Carmack 

- Wolfenstein 3D (1992)
- Doom
- Licensed his engine to Raven -> ShadowCaster

Concept: Separating execution of core functionality by the game engine from the creative assets.

- Quake -> OpenGL on **Graphics Card** -> full real-time 3D rendering / Network sync

!! Driving Force for **Game Engine Dev** -> Hardware Developement

### Current Age

Zoo of Game Engine:

- Commercial Engine: Unreal, Unity, CryEngine
- In-house Engine: Frostbite, Source, Rage, Infinity Ward
- Free Engine: Stride, Godot, O3DE (Light Weight)

Middlewares:

- Physics & Animation: Havoc, PhysX
- Sound: Wise
- Rendering: True Sky, Enlighten
- Other: Speedtree (lord of ring), Simplygon

## What's Game Engine

- Techonology Foundation of Matrix
  - Define the differences between real and unreal, true world and virtual world
- Productivity Tools of Creation
- Art of Complexity
  - imperfect, compromises



Complex, but basic simulation by 0/1 (Turing machine)

Computer Graphisc takes only 10% of the Game Engine

### Real-time

God with Limited Power in **Realtime**

- Frame Rate
- Hardware power

### Toolchain

Massive Toolchain for creators from **difference background and ability** (Artist, Designer, Other Programmers)

Developer Platform

- for Programmer -> Expandable API
- for Studio -> **Collaborate** hundreds of developers smoothly

### On Fly

update the engine on the fly ~ just like replace the whole plane on the flight

Understand the **Flow**

## How to Study

Focus on the **Framework**!!

Source Syllabus
